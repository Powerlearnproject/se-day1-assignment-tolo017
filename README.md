Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systematic disciplined approach to designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software systems.
1. Managing complexity - Breaks down complex problems into manageable modules, enabling teamwork and reducing development risks.
2. Ensuring quality and reliability - Systematic testing and best practices ensure software meets performance standards and user expectations.
3. Cost effectiveness and efficiency - Early detection of issues reduces costly fixes post-deployment.
4. Security - Incorporates security protocols to protect against breaches.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Mastering machine(1956-1967) - Hardware dependent high level languages.
2. Mastering process(1968-1982) - Development process software engineering.
3. Mastering complexity(1983-1992) - Expanding data and functional convergence.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning - Define project goals, scope, timeline, and budget of the current system if applicable.

Requirement gathering - Identify the final user needs.

Design - Creating the framework.

Development(Coding) - Translating the design into actual code.

Testing - Evaluating the software to identify and fix bugs.

Deployment - Distributing the software to the production environment to make it available for users.

Maintenance - Ongoing support after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The Waterfall Methodology is a linear, sequential approach where projects progress through distinct phases without revisiting previous stages. Ideal for projects with fixed requirements and minimal expected changes, like construction.

The Agile model places emphasis on flexible, iterative progress by breaking down the project into smaller, more manageable units of work. Suited for dynamic environments where requirements evolve, like software development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer - Responsible for writing the code and developing the entire software product.
 > Developing applications, programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 > Maintaining and updating software to keep it functional.
 > Collaborating with other team members to ensure best practices when developing software.
 > Report to the project manager about the progress of the software development.

Quality Assurance Engineer - Creates tests that identify issues with software before it is deployed.
 > Collaborates with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirements.
 > Creates development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow.
 > Confirm that software meets the requirements before deployment.
 > Analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient.

Project Manager - Oversees project execution, timelines, and team coordination.
 > Planning of milestones and deliverables.
 > Assigns tasks and balance workloads.
 > Risk management.
 > Bridges stakeholders and the team.
 > Monitors metrics and report status.
 > Resolves conflicts and foster collaborations.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An IDE is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. Example, Visual Studio Code.

 Importance:
> Code editing automation
> Syntax highlighting
> Intelligent code completion
> Testing
> Debugging

A VCS are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
 
 Importance:
> Collaboration
> Change Tracking
> Branching and Merging
> Error Recovery

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 > Keeping up with technology.
 > Complex codebases
 > Security concerns
 > Burnout

How to overcome them:
 > Continuous learning
 > Code reviews and pair programming
 > Prioritize security
 > Time management

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing examining individual components. Helps identify and fix bugs early in the development cycle, minimizing the cost of fixing issues later.
Integration testing checking how components interact. Ensures seamless communication and data flow between different parts of the software system.
System testing evaluating the entire system. Verifies that the system performs as expected in a real-world scenario, including performance, security, and usability aspects.
Acceptance testing verifying if the software meets user requirements before deployment. Provides critical feedback from the intended users to identify any usability issues or gaps in functionality before deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI.
 > Greater developer control.
 > Improved user experience.
 > Increased flexibility.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Write an essay about climate change.
Write an essay about climate change explaining three practical solutions to reduce carbon footprints in urban areas. Use accessible language.
The improved prompt is more effective since it is detailed, specific, and outlines all the requirements.
